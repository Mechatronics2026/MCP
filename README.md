**A concise hub for learning and exploring the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — curated examples, servers, and walkthroughs for students, researchers, and engineers, (Arduino / ROS / Vision / Home Assistant).**



## 🔎 Overview
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a lightweight, practical approach to expose model-driven context and commands to devices and systems — from Arduino and Home Assistant to ROS-based robots and computer-vision pipelines.  
This repository complements the live demo site (served from `index`) and points visitors to the best starting resources, reference servers, example implementations, and video walkthroughs so they can quickly learn and experiment with MCP-based integrations.

**Live demo / landing page:** https://mechatronics2026.github.io/MCP/



## 🎯 Who this is for
- 👨‍🎓 Mechatronics students and lab instructors who want hands-on MCP demos.  
- 🤖 Robotics and automation engineers exploring model-driven orchestration.  
- 💻 Developers building integrations between LLMs/agents and hardware (edge devices, ROS, vision systems).



## 🔎 What to look for here
This repo acts as a start index: the landing page (`index`) shows the concept and demos; this README points to deeper resources — where to get reference servers, example projects you can clone, and curated video guides to watch next.



## 📚 Core reference & official servers
- **Model Context Protocol — reference servers**  
  https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers  
  Primary collection of MCP server implementations and canonical examples. If you want official/reference server code, start here.



## 🧩 Example servers & platform integrations
These repositories are practical examples you can clone and inspect to see MCP used in real systems:

- 🔌 **Home Assistant integration**  
  https://github.com/tevonsb/homeassistant-mcp  
  Example that connects MCP endpoints with Home Assistant automations and event flows.

- 🧮 **MATLAB tools**  
  https://github.com/neuromechanist/matlab-mcp-tools  
  Tools to send/receive MCP messages from MATLAB workflows — useful for data analysis and control prototyping.

- 🖥️ **OpenCV / Vision pipeline**  
  https://github.com/GongRzhe/opencv-mcp-server  
  Exposes computer-vision processing via MCP (object detection, tracking outputs over MCP).

- 🤝 **ROS MCP server**  
  https://github.com/robotmcp/ros-mcp-server  
  Bridge between ROS topics/services and MCP for laboratory robotics and research stacks.

- 🏭 **Universal Robots adapter**  
  https://github.com/nonead/Nonead-Universal-Robots-MCP  
  Shows how to adapt MCP to industrial robot controllers (UR series) for orchestration demos.

- 🔋 **Arduino minimal MCP server**  
  https://github.com/amahpour/arduino-mcp-server-simple  
  Small-footprint example to turn a microcontroller into an MCP endpoint for classroom experiments.
